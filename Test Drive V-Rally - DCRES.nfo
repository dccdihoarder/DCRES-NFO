                           Dreamcast Resurrection - 2009 (since 2008)
===================================================================================================
Check for more releases at these forums (search for user "TuxTheWise"):

NOTE: I've seen some people uploading my releases in other servers. I recommend you always getting
my releases of my uploads in the forums above, because sometimes I release fixes or re-launch some
games that have problems. If you get my uploads you'll be sure of having the latest releases.
Additionally, you'll get the original package, not images made from discs, so you'll be sure that
nothing is corrupted.

Test Drive V-Rally (NTSC-U)
---------------------------
Ripped: Most CDDA edited.
Downsampled: Videos.
Source: GD dump and Echelon's release (oRARs)

This game was launched in Europe under the name "V-Rally 2: Expert Edition".

Most CDDA had to be edited to make the game fit on a CD-R and the videos had to be downsampled.
However, I used another MPEG encoder that works much better with dark scenes than my old one, so I
doubt you'll notice any difference. Fade-out has been added in the CDDA, so it won't be a problem
too.

I tried to release the PAL version of this game, but even with the 50/60hz selector in the options
menu, it presented a lot of graphics glitches when booting in 60hz. So I had to use the NTSC-U
version. Note that it also have 3 languages (English, French and German) that can be selected in
the options menu.

Usual CDDA hack was not working, and the tracks were not playing at all. Echelon made the same
mistake at their first release, but after they have released a patch to correct it, making a great
job as usual. I've hacked my binary the same way they did, so the credit for CDDA working goes all
to the Echelon dudes.

PAL users, the game will already boot in 60hz in your console.

Note that "Music volume" must be increased in the options menu, otherwise you won't be able to
hear the CDDA tracks. It probably happens on the original GD too, so don't blame me for that.

Oh, and this is one of the few games with 16/9 widescren support. Additionally, this game has
great graphics and run on very solid 60fps. So use a VGA-Box to plug your console on a high
definition TV and be surprised with what your Dreamcast can do.

Have fun.

Features of my release:
- Not corrupted files at all, it was made with GD dump files and Echelon's oRARs.
- Used custom DCRES optimization techniques. It means faster loadings and less Dreamcast reader
noise.
- Selfboot.

About the game:
- It has VGA Box support.

Other comments:
- "Extras" folder in the pack contains some useless stuff.
- Release comes with covers.
