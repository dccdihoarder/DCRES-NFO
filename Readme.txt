This is what you've been looking for, the last releases of the games!

Games distributed on password-protected packs were repacked without it.

Please notice that DCRES has evolved a lot over time. It started by 
simply making games selfboot, downsampling some things and using GD file 
order, and ended a much bigger thing. Highly cool custom optimization 
techniques have been developed, protections have been broken, custom 
formats of files opened from scratch. Games never released properly had 
been make it available for everyone to play on their Dreamcasts with 
high quality, others that had good releases were made better. Not bad 
for a one man project right? 

However, as I mentioned, things were evolving over time, so it's 
expected to find not so good releases among the list, mostly the older 
ones. For example, giving a quick look I can see some releases like Dead 
Or Alive 2, Half-Life and Power Stone 2 that potentially could have been 
made much better. I see "Genesis Collection" and regret of having 
released an emulator pack under DCRES title. My wish was to review all 
of them, but unfortunately that's not going to happen. 

Anyway, looking back now, I'm very proud of my work. I'm very proud of 
having been part of the scene (even if so many years later!) of one of 
the greatest consoles of all time. 

Now stop reading and go get some CD-Rs :)
